# Welcome to Rylab

## Why bother?
I write a lot of analysis scripts and they end up all over the place with
different version being copied and pasted around with bugs never being fixed.
By putting it into a package I can easily keep it updated, and share it!

## What it can do
See each python submodule for better info. 
For now it can handle transfer
functions as general complex functions.
Make nice plots of PSDs and other data.
Some good version of complicated functions for modeling cavity resonances.
Unpack data from various sources like zurich lock-ins.
